    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Noya Studio develops and publishes social games for the web and mobile devices. "Noya Studio," or "we" or "us" refers to Noya Studio Online Game Development (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. and Shenzhen Dong Fang BoYa Technology Co., Ltd. in this Privacy Policy.
        The Noya Studio Corporate Family means Noya Studio's subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership and/or any of their agents, consultants, employees, officers and directors. This Privacy Policy
        applies whenever you play our games or otherwise access any of our other products, services, content, Noya Studio.com and/or the other domains provided by Noya Studio, together referred to as "Services." This Privacy Policy describes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>what information we collect, how we collect it, and why</li>
        <li>how we use that information and with whom we share it</li>
        <li>how you can access and update that information</li>
        <li>the choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your information</li>
        <li>how we protect the information we store about you</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you do not want Noya Studio to collect, store, use or share your information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you may not play Noya Studio's games or use Noya Studio's Services.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h3>
    <p>Information About You That We Get From Connected Third-Party Applications, Including Social Networks (like Facebook)</p>
    <p>If you play Noya Studio's games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or connect our Services to any third-party applications, including social networks like Facebook, Noya Studio may receive certain information
        about you from the provider of the third-party application. The information we receive depends on the Noya Studio game you're playing, the third-party application, your privacy settings and, if applicable, your friends' privacy settings on that
        third-party application. For example, Noya Studio may collect and store some or all of the following information shared by the provider of the connected third-party application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>your first and last name;</li>
        <li>your profile picture or its URL;</li>
        <li>your user ID number (like your Facebook ID number), which may be linked to publicly-available information like your name and profile photo;</li>
        <li>the user ID number and other public data for your friends;</li>
        <li>the login e-mail you provided to that third-party application when you registered with it;</li>
        <li>your physical location and that of the devices you use to access our Services;</li>
        <li>your gender;</li>
        <li>your birthday and/or age range;</li>
        <li>information about your activities on or through the connected third-party application;</li>
        <li>other publicly-available information on the third-party application; and/or</li>
        <li>any other information that you or the provider of the third-party application share with Noya Studio.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you access our Services from a third-party application or connect our Services to a third-party application, you should also read that third-party application's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their privacy practices.</p>

    <h3>Cookies and Automated Information Collection</h3>
    <p>We and service providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, store log files and use tracking technologies such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cookies, which are small pieces of data transferred to your mobile device or computer for record-keeping purposes;</li>
        <li>web beacons, which let us know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened;</li>
        <li>tracking pixels, which allow us or our advertising partners to advertise more efficiently and effectively;</li>
        <li>local shared objects, also known as flash cookies, which help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load times.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We and our service providers use these log files, tags, and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP addresses;</li>
        <li>the type of computer or mobile device you are using;</li>
        <li>your operating system version;</li>
        <li>your mobile device's identifiers, like your MAC Address, Identifier For Advertising (IDFA), and/or International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI);</li>
        <li>your browser types;</li>
        <li>your browser language;</li>
        <li>referring and exit pages, and URLs;</li>
        <li>platform type;</li>
        <li>the number of clicks on a page or feature;</li>
        <li>domain names;</li>
        <li>landing pages;</li>
        <li>pages viewed and the order of those pages;</li>
        <li>the amount of time spent on particular pages;</li>
        <li>game state and the date and time of activity on our websites or games.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In some cases, we will connect this information with your social network ID or Noya Studio user ID.</p>


    <h3>Other Information from Your Mobile Device</h3>
    <p>If you play Noya Studio games on your mobile device, in addition to your device identifiers, we may also collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the name you have associated with your device;</li>
        <li>your telephone number;</li>
        <li>your country; and</li>
        <li>your specific geolocation;</li>
        <li>your mobile contacts (as further described below in "Information About Your Contacts"); and</li>
        <li>information about Noya Studio and other third-party apps you have on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information About You That You Share With Us Directly</h3>
    <p>When you use our Services (whether through a social network or through Noya Studio directly), you may give us information directly (like when you're setting up your account) and we will store that on our systems and use it for the purposes described
        in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Some games or parts of our Services may use a more traditional registration or account set-up process where you may be asked to give us some or all of the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>your age or birthday;</li>
        <li>your first and last names;</li>
        <li>your e-mail address;</li>
        <li>a password; and</li>
        <li>ï‚·other information that helps us make sure it's you accessing your account or helps us improve our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may also let you create a player profile, separate from your social networking site profile (for example, your Facebook profile), that other Noya Studio players can see. Your player profile may include information like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a profile photo;</li>
        <li>game username(s);</li>
        <li>your gender;</li>
        <li>biographic details (like your age or age range);</li>
        <li>approximate location information that you provide;</li>
        <li>links to your profiles on various social network;</li>
        <li>details about the games you play; and</li>
        <li>a Noya Studio player ID number that is created by Noya Studio and used to identify your profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Certain information in your Noya Studio profile may be publicly accessible on Noya Studio's websites that offer direct access to Noya Studio games, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Noya Studio player ID;</li>
        <li>Your first and last names;</li>
        <li>Your player profile picture.</li>
        <li>Your first and last names;</li>
        <li>Your player profile picture.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Except for games designed for children under 13, your Noya Studio player ID number used to identify your account and player profile will appear in the URL of your profile page. It will only allow access to information you make public in your settings.</p>
    <h3>Information About Your Contacts</h3>
    <p>We may give you the ability to import your address book contacts or manually enter them so that you can locate your contacts on Noya Studio and invite them to join you in our games or other aspects of our Services. You are responsible for getting
        your contacts' permission when you opt to give their contact details to us. We may also get information about you from other Noya Studio users importing or entering their contacts. We use and may store this contact information to help you and
        your contacts connect through our Services. If you want to remove your contacts stored by us, follow the instructions provided in the game to request that we remove them from our systems. If you need to enter a password to allow us to access your
        address book, we will not store that password.</p>

    <h3>Information You Generate Using Our Communications Features</h3>
    <p>Except for games designed for children under 13, you may be able to take part in certain activities on our Service that let you communicate or share information not just with Noya Studio, but also with other Noya Studio players. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>participating in player forums and message boards;</li>
        <li>posting public comments to other players' profiles or gameboards;</li>
        <li>sending private messages or invitations to other players, either directly on our websites or to their e-mail accounts;</li>
        <li>chatting with other players; </li>
        <li>posting photos or drawings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You acknowledge and expressly agree that we may access in real-time, record and/or store archives of these communications, comments, photos and drawings on Noya Studio's servers to make use of them to protect the safety and well-being of our players
        and Noya Studio's rights and property in connection with our Services; to conduct research; to operate, improve, personalize and optimize our Services and our players' experiences, including through the use of analytics; and to manage and deliver
        contextual advertising.</p>

    <h3>Payment Information</h3>
    <p>If you purchase a license to use in-game virtual currency or virtual items in a game you play on Noya Studio.com, our third-party payment processor will collect the billing and financial information it needs to process your charges. This may include
        your postal address, e-mail address and financial information. Noya Studio does not collect or store your financial information, like credit card numbers. However, Noya Studio's payment processors may share non-financial information with us related
        to your purchases, like your name, billing address and the items purchased in order to fulfill your order. Noya Studio may also obtain the billing and payment information that you provide when your purchase is processed by someone else (like Facebook,
        Apple or Google) such as when you purchase something in a game you play on a social network or that you downloaded on your mobile device. Our Terms of Service explain our policies and terms relevant to our charges, billing practices, third-party
        credits and virtual currencies. Please note that purchases of third party credits or currencies may also be subject to those parties' policies.</p>


    <h3>Customer Support Correspondence</h3>
    <p>Except as provided herein, when you ask for help from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them (generally, your name and e-mail address), information about your game play or activity on our Services,
        and your Noya Studio player and/or social network ID number. We will also store the communications you have with the Customer Service team and any information in those communications in order to provide support and improve the Services. For users
        of our games designed for children under 13, we will use your contact information for the sole purpose of providing a one-time response to your question. We will then delete your information from our servers.</p>

    <h3>Information You Give Us For Text Messaging Services</h3>
    <p>We receive and store the information you provide, including your mobile telephone number, when you choose to sign up to receive SMS messages.</p>

    <h3>Other Sources</h3>
    <p>We may collect or receive information about you from other sources like third-party information providers. We use this information along with information you provide us directly, for example, to help you and your friends connect or to serve you advertising
        more tailored to your interests.</p>

    <h3>How We Use the Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>The main use of the information we collect and store is to provide a better gaming experience, but there are other uses as well. The uses for which we collect and store your information include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>to operate, improve and optimize our Services and our players' experiences;</li>
        <li>to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games;</li>
        <li>to identify and suggest connections with other Noya Studio players and personalize our Services to you;</li>
        <li>to enable players to communicate with each other;</li>
        <li>to provide technical support and respond to player inquiries;</li>
        <li>to protect the safety and well-being of our players;</li>
        <li>to protect Noya Studio's rights and property in connection with our Services;</li>
        <li>to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Service;</li>
        <li>to manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising;</li>
        <li>to notify players of in-game updates, new products or promotional offers;</li>
        <li>to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners;</li>
        <li>to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third parties; and</li>
        <li>to conduct research.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to Noya Studio, we will use it to respond to customer support inquiries, and keep you informed of your in-game activity, including comments from friends,
        let you know about in-game status such as "crops ready" as well as tell you about gift and neighbor requests. Some messages, like invites for friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional
        e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (e.g. text messages) ("Promotional Communications") directly or in partnership with other parties, in accordance with your marketing preferences. Each Promotional Communication will offer you choices
        about receiving additional messages. Receipt of such communications depends on Noya Studio having certain contact information from you. If you play one of our games designed for children under 13, you will not be able to provide us with certain
        contact information. Please see the section on Our Policies Concerning Children for more information.</p>

    <h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>
    <p>We may disclose or publish aggregated information and other non-personal information about our players for industry analysis, demographic profiling, marketing, analytics, advertising, and other business purposes.</p>
    <p>In addition, we may share your information (which may include personal information) with third parties (in other words, parties other than Noya Studio) or allow third parties to collect this information from our Services in the following circumstances:</p>

    <h3>Your Consent</h3>
    <p>With your consent, we may share your information with third parties or allow them to collect your information from our Services in some ways not specifically described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>Friends and Other Noya Studio Players</h3>
    <p>The Service supports and often encourages you to interact with other players. In most Noya Studio games, if you play through a social network or register through a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends will see
        your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity. Similarly, in many Noya Studio games, other players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends or not, will be able to see descriptions of your game activity (including
        the identification of any Noya Studio games you have played), communicate with you within our Services, and view your game profile, which may include your name or a "game name" and your profile photo. For example, in Noya Studio Poker, any other
        player may see your game profile if you are playing at the same table. In certain cases, your profile photo can reveal your social network ID or Noya Studio player ID, and access to a social network ID or Noya Studio player ID may allow others
        to view the public information associated with your related social network profile or Noya Studio account. Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the related social network's or Noya Studio's communication
        channels.
    </p>

    <h3>The Safety, Security and Compliance with Law</h3>
    <p>Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications in our Services and between You and Noya Studio may be accessed and monitored as needed to provide our Service and may be disclosed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>when we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose the information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or legal process (for example, a court order,
            search warrant or subpoena);</li>
        <li>to satisfy any laws or regulations that apply;</li>
        <li>where we believe in our sole discretion that the Service is being used in committing a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to share information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit
            risk reduction, and other security precautions;</li>
        <li>when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and</li>
        <li>to protect the rights or property of Noya Studio and other applicable third parties, including to enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We will share your information with third-party companies to perform services on our behalf, like processing payments, analyzing data, optimizing game play, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to help us in our marketing efforts,
        including managing and delivering contextual and tailored advertisements. We contractually require these third-party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information we share with them, and we contractually require them not
        use your information for anything other than to provide services on our behalf.</p>

    <h3>Sale or Merger</h3>
    <p>In the event that Noya Studio undergoes a business transition (including proposed transactions), like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part its assets (like selling a game), we may disclose or transfer all of your information,
        including personal information, to the successor organization in the transition. We will make reasonable efforts to let you and other players know (in the way described in Changes to Our Privacy Policy) of the business transition before transferring
        your personal information.</p>
    <h3>How to Access, Update and Manage Your Information</h3>
    <p>Information We Receive From a Third-Party Application Where You Play Our Games or From Your Mobile Device</p>
    <p>To manage the information Noya Studio receives about you from a third-party application where you play our games, like Facebook, you will need to follow the instructions for the third-party application for updating your information and changing your
        privacy settings. The privacy management tools for applications on Facebook can be found here. To review and update information associated with your Noya Studio game profile in certain games, visit the "settings" page in that game. You also can
        manage some aspects of information collection and use by visiting the "settings" page of your mobile device and reviewing the permissions of each application or "app."</p>
    <p>Once Noya Studio receives your information from a third-party application or your mobile device, that information is stored and used by Noya Studio in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may access and update that information as described below.</p>

    <h3>Accessing and Updating Your Information Held by Noya Studio</h3>
    <p>If you want to review, delete, or change the information Noya Studio has about you or have additional questions, e-mail us at postmaster@ill-winter.com.</p>

    <h3>Stopping Use of Your Information</h3>
    <p>If you no longer want Noya Studio to make active use of your information, you may send an e-mail to postmaster@ill-winter.com. Place "Delete My Account" in the subject line and include your first name, last name, e-mail address and your social network
        ID for the social network from which you access our Services (if applicable) in the body of the e-mail (for example, your Facebook user ID). We will respond to your request within thirty days. Please note that certain records, for example those
        relating to payments or customer service matters, will be held for legal and accounting purposes. If you have sent content through or posted content on the Service, we may not be able to delete it.</p>

    <h3>Opting Out of Geolocation</h3>
    <p>If you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can stop making geolocation available to us by visiting your mobile device's settings for the relevant application or the "settings" page for the relevant game.</p>

    <p>Opting Out of Ongoing Collection of Information About Non-Noya Studio Apps You Have On Your Device</p>
    <p>To the extent that one of our games is collecting information about non-Noya Studio apps you have on your device, the game will provide you with an option to stop making that information available to us in the "settings" page for the relevant game.</p>

    <h3>Opting Out of Promotional Emails from Noya Studio</h3>
    <p>If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from Noya Studio, click on the "unsubscribe" link in any promotional email from Noya Studio or visit the e-mail preference page. Please note that once we receive your request, it may take an additional
        period of time for your opt-out to become effective. Your unsubscribe or e-mail preference change will be processed promptly, and in no event longer than ten business days.</p>

    <h3>Opting Out of Other Communications</h3>
    <p>You can opt out of receiving SMS messages (for example, text messages) by texting back STOP to the number we send the text from for that particular SMS message program. In some cases a preferences management page will also be available. When we receive
        an opt-out message from you for SMS messages, we may send a message confirming our receipt of your opt-out.</p>
    <p>When you install our apps on your mobile device you can choose to receive push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even when the app is not on. You can turn off notifications by visiting your mobile device's "settings"
        page.
    </p>

    <h3>Opting Out of Cookie Tracking</h3>
    <p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not
        remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.</p>
    <p>If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of our Services because Noya Studio cookies are necessary to track and enhance your game activities.</p>
    <h3>Privacy Policies of Linked Third-Party Services and Advertisers</h3>

    <p>Our websites and games may contain advertisements from Third-Party Services, which are companies other than Noya Studio that may link to their own websites, online services or mobile applications. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or
        the content of these Third-Party Services. If you have any questions about how these Third-Party Services use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.</p>

    <h3>Our Policies Concerning Children</h3>
    <p>Most of our websites and games are not for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. Children under 13 should not use these websites or games at any time. If we learn that we have
        inadvertently gathered personal information from a child under 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that information from our records.</p>
    <p>Noya Studio provides education games, like Words with Friends EDU, which are intended to be enjoyed by parents, teachers, and children of all ages. Noya Studio may also provide games like Looney Tunes Dash, which are intended for users of all ages.
        In these games, Noya Studio does not knowingly collect personal information (as that term is defined under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)) from users under the age of 13, except as permitted by COPPA. For example, Noya Studio
        may collect persistent identifiers to support the internal operations of its games. If Noya Studio learns that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information that is not subject to a COPPA exception, Noya Studio will delete
        such information.</p>

    <h3>How Long We Keep Your Information</h3>
    <p>How long we retain your information depends on why we collected it and how we use it. We will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements. For instance, we may retain some information
        for a few years after you have closed your account with us if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights.</p>

    <h3>Security of Your Information</h3>
    <p>We implement security measures to help protect the security of your information both online and offline. We take steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures vary based upon the sensitivity
        of your information.</p>
    <p>If you have an account registered directly with Noya Studio, your profile information is protected by the password you use to access your Noya Studio account. It is important that you protect and maintain your Noya Studio account's security and that
        you immediately tell us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your Noya Studio account, the Service allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. If you access
        our Services through a social network and your social network account is hacked, this may lead to someone playing your Noya Studio games without your permission. So, be careful to keep your social network account information, including your social
        network account password, secure as well. We urge you to log out of your Noya Studio account and any social network account you have used to access our Services after you use it.</p>
    <p>When you sign into your Noya Studio account or enter payment information, we or our third party payment processor use encryption to transmit that information.</p>
    <p>While we take precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other
        breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our Service. Any transmission is at your own risk. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please contact us
        at postmaster@ill-winter.com.</p>

    <h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will tell you and other players by placing a notice on Noya Studio.com or its equivalent in-game, or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you prior to the
        change becoming effective. We may supplement this process by placing notices on game blogs, social network pages, and/or forums and on other Noya Studio websites. You should periodically check www.Noya Studio.com and this privacy page for updates.</p>
